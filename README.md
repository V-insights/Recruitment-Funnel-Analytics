**Recruitment Funnel Analytics**
This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the recruitment funnel using real-world candidate data. It combines data exploration, machine learning, and dashboard visualization to identify patterns in hiring decisions and improve overall recruitment efficiency.

**Objective**
To predict whether a candidate will be hired based on features like education, experience, skillsets, and company background. The project also aims to provide insights into where candidates drop off in the hiring process.

**Key Insights from EDA**
Candidates with relevant degrees and experience had a higher likelihood of being hired.
The hiring rate was comparatively higher among applicants from large companies and with a full-time university enrollment.
Certain disciplines like STEM fields had better hiring probabilities.

**Model Development**
  Algorithms Used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
  Best Model: Random Forest (Accuracy: 78.28%)
  Target Variable: 'hired' (1 = Hired, 0 = Not Hired)
  Missing values were handled using context-based imputation techniques.
  Label Encoding was applied to categorical features.

**Power BI Dashboard**
  The interactive dashboard includes:
  KPIs: Total Applicants, Hired Candidates, Model Accuracy
  Bar Charts: Hiring trends by gender, experience, education level, etc.
  Funnel Chart: Application to Hiring stages
  Filters/Slicers: For detailed drilldown analysis by company type, discipline, etc.

**Outcomes**
  Built a complete machine learning pipeline from raw data to prediction
  Designed a professional-level dashboard to present findings in a clear and actionable format
  Gained hands-on experience in both data science and business intelligence
